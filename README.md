# A.I-SEARCHING
This project demonstrates the implementation of searching Algorithms in Python

In this code, i have implemented Depth first search and Breadth first search. 
The program will use the best method out of the two basing on the inputs i.e maze1.txt, maze2.txt and maze3.txt.

You can comment out one of the two techniques and see how each technique works.
